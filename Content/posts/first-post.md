# Dumbledore - Speech about Cedric Diggory

The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so â€“ either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.

```
func codeExample() -> String {
    return "Hello world!"
}
```
